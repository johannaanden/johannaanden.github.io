How does the % operator work?
If we have a % b, then it calculate everithing for me and tells med whats is left.

example: 10 % 3 = 1
It means that number 3 fits in numer 10 3 times, and that 1 is left

exempel: 3 % 10 = 3
The fact is that nummer 3 is much smaller than number 10, it's a difference of 7, and the result of that is that number 3 won't fit even once in number 10.
That will result that number 3 will be the result of 3 % 10.

What is the difference between = and ==?
= You use this to assign the value of a variable. It's an assignment operator. 
== This one checks whether tow values are equal.
